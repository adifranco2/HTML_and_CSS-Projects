			The invasive Burmese python, which breeds and multiplies quickly and has no natural predator in the 
			Everglades ecosystem, has decimated native populations of wildlife. The more that can be eliminated, 
			especially females and their eggs, the better chance future generations of native wildlife will have to 
			thrive in the Everglades ecosystem that Floridians have invested billions of dollars to restore.
